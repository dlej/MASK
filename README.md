# MASK
MASK: a framework for dimensionality reduction of variable-length sequences using RNTK

This repository generates the resuls from the paper _Wearing a MASK: Compressed Representations of Variable-Length Sequences Using Recurrent Neural Tangent Kernels_.

RNTK implementation in `ODE-Caeuler.ipynb` and `util.py` are taken from [https://github.com/thegregyang/NTK4A](https://github.com/thegregyang/NTK4A).
